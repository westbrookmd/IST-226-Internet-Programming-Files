      <h2>My Portfolio: Graded Practice Files from IST226</h2>
      <div class="chapters">
         <button type="button" class="chapter0">Web Server Setup</button>

            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter0/hello226.html">Live Link: Web Server Setup</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter0.png" alt="Screenshot of the first graded practice file." />
            <p>Creating a web server account and submitting a test page to demonstrate our knowledge and completion of this step.</p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter1">Chapter 1</button>
         <div id="chapter1">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter1/ct_start.html">Live Link: Chapter 1</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter1.png" alt="Screenshot of the second graded practice file." />
            <p>A basic introduction to HTML5. Covered learning about networks, web pages, web servers, the history of HTML, elements,
               file creation, character encoding, and basic grouping via lists. Additionally covered using classes and id attributes to
               better organize pages.
            </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter2">Chapter 2</button>
         <div id="chapter2">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter2/tss_home.html">Live Link: Chapter 2</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter2.png" alt="Screenshot of the third graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter introduced style sheets through Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This chapter discussed using different font
               sizes and learning about scaling to the appropriate view port. A brief introduction to padding, margins, classes, and more.
            </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter2">Chapter 3</button>
         <div id="chapter3">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter3/pc_home.html">Live Link: Chapter 3</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter3.png" alt="Screenshot of the fourth graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter covered page layouts. Fixed, fluid, elastic, and grid layouts were covered. Positioning was
               emphasized to explain how to not corner your design into just using grids. </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter4">Chapter 4</button>
         <div id="chapter4">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter4/tb_komatsu.html">Live Link: Chapter 4</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter4.png" alt="Screenshot of the fifth graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter covered graphic design using CSS. This was a lot of information to cover. Most of the difficult parts for me
               were concerned with images, whether it be changing background images or editing images with CSS transforms or filters. Gradients
               were my favorite part of this chapter.
            </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter5">Chapter 5</button>
         <div id="chapter5">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter5/tf_home.html">Live Link: Chapter 5</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter5.png" alt="Screenshot of the sixth graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter was focused on mobile web design. This introduced responsive design (which I tried my hardest to design this portfolio
               as a responsive layout). Flexible boxes, flexible items, and flex box layouts were the hardest parts for me to grasp. 
            </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter6">Chapter 6</button>
         <div id="chapter6">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter6/dlr_evenings.html">Live Link: Chapter 6</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter6.png" alt="Screenshot of the seventh graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter was about tables and columns. Table borders, spans for rows and columns, and using groups were the highlights that I
               really paid close attention to. Column layouts were hard to grasp at first, but I really began to understand them from this graded
               practice file. </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter7">Chapter 7</button>
         <div id="chapter7">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter7/rb_survey.html">Live Link: Chapter 7</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter7.png" alt="Screenshot of the eighth graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter and graded practice was focused on web forms. I never knew how many different types of input there were before this 
               chapter. The input type that I feel like I will use the most (that I didn't know about before) is the "tel" input type. Being
               able to use this type to give mobile users a number pad by default is great.
            </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter8">Chapter 8</button>
         <div id="chapter8">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter8/cp_royal.html">Live Link: Chapter 8</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter8.png" alt="Screenshot of the ninth graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter and graded practice was all about multimedia. I really enjoyed this graded practice because it had an excellent
               video that encouraged transitions, key frames, and a cue text. Additionally, learning about how pages with transitions are 
               rendered was really interesting.
            </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter9">Chapter9</button>
         <div id="chapter9">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter9/tny_clock.html">Live Link: Chapter 9</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter9.png" alt="Screenshot of the tenth graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter and graded practice was all about JavaScript. JavaScript was not something I expected to learn in this class,
               but it very quickly became something that I sought out and read about since it is still very new to me. Learning how to
               dynamically change HTML code via JavaScript is something that is amazing once you get the hang of it. I utilized event handlers
               in this page for each of the chapters of my portfolio thanks to this chapter.
            </p>
         </div>
         <br>
         <button type="button" class="chapter10">Chapter 10</button>
         <div id="chapter10">
            <h3><a href="http://ist226westbrookmd.atwebpages.com/chapter10/lht_august.html">Live Link: Chapter 10</a></h3>
            <img src="Chapter10.png" alt="Screenshot of the eleventh graded practice file." />
            <p>This chapter and graded practice described how arrays, loops, and conditional statements work in JavaScript. This chapter made
               me realize how different JavaScript really is compared to Java, C#, Python, and basically any other language I have used. Not
               having the strict typing that C# and Java offer is really aggravating. I expect to learn TypeScript in the near-future to 
               work around this feature. I like how mapping and filtering was described very early in this chapter. Most other books that I have
               read wait so long before introducing these concepts but I feel as if they are critical to learn early.

         I narrate the basic usage of the program to encrypt and decrypt data. I have an audio player below it if
